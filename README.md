# PBM project: Sloshing simulation with DualSPHysics

This is a small python project controlling the execution of
DualSPHysics simulating the sloshing of a fluid within a
rotating container.

** Work in progress! **

## Setup

Create a subdirectory `execs` and place the executables of DualSPHysics there.

Execute the simulation with python with the following command:

```
python simulate.py
```

## Requirements

* Python 3
* DualSPHysics 4
* Ubuntu 16.04 (other linux systems should work) or Windows

MAC OS X is not supported since DualSPHysics cannot be compiled for MAC right now.
